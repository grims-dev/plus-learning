                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                    <p>My name is Francesca Grimshaw, and I am a private tutor specialising in preparation for 11+ school entrance exams, such as Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School (BRGS) which has now adopted a CEM-style entrance exam. My eldest son and daughter were both educated at BRGS and I also currently have sons in Years 10 and 8 at BRGS.</p>

                    <!-- /wp:heading -->

                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                    <p>I have been a qualified teacher for almost 25 years and a tutor for a number of years, holding a full and current DBS (formerly CRB) certificate. I attended Lancaster University College of St Martin and graduated in 1995 with a 2:1 BA Honours degree in Education and English.</p>
                    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                    <p>Before my teaching degree, I worked in retail and later in banking. As part of my studies, I taught in many primary schools across Lancashire and went straight from university to a permanent job as a Year 5 class teacher, although I've taught the entire primary age range during my career.</p>

                    <h2>Why Tutor?</h2>
                    <!-- /wp:heading -->

                    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                    <p>I love teaching and being a tutor. I enjoy motivating children to learn and aim to make learning fun and memorable. It is so rewarding to see children grow in confidence and make progress in areas they'd previously been worried about or were struggling to understand. I am proud of the high pass rates my students achieve; in 2018, 80% of my students who started their studies in autumn achieved above the BRGS exam pass mark, and in 2019 that number rose to 85%.</p>

                    I would highly recommend Francesca, not only is she a fantastic tutor, she has a natural presence and rapport with her students. Our personal experience and journey with both of our boys over the years have been second to none. Both boys have loved going to her and in return, we’ve seen them develop into what they are today. Not only did they both get the results required for BRGS, they’ve gained the foundations for life going forward. I must say it’s been the best investment we’ve made and to see the results is priceless.<br><br>
                    Thank you Francesca, keep up your amazing work and keep educating our future children.

                    I cannot thank Francesca enough for her work with my daughter in prep for her SATS, raising her confidence in transition to high school. Personal & tailored education. Highly recommended.

                    Sam really enjoyed his tutoring with Francesca, it helped him massively, not just for the 11+ but also gave him more confidence. Francesca always gets the best out of her students and has an excellent rapport with them.

                    When I was in search of a tutor for my son in prep for the 2016 BRGS entrance exam, Francesca's name came up many a time and I was very keen to book a slot for him. Over the course of the sessions, I noticed his confidence rocket sky high. I never had any doubts whatsoever about Francesca's ability and knowledge and I believe she is highly competent in her teaching.
                    <br><br>
                    Our wishes were granted a few weeks after the exam when I got the letter to say he had been accepted! We were so happy, and to be very honest he would never be starting BRGS in 2017 if it wasn't due to Francesca and her efforts. I have made a friend for life for sure. I will definitely very highly recommend you to parents whose child is planning on taking entrance exams.
